# Snake Game

A classic Snake game implemented in Java. This project is a beginner-friendly game development project that helps understand basic game logic, GUI handling, and Java programming concepts.

## About the Game

This is a simple Snake game where the player controls a snake to eat food, grow longer, and avoid collisions with the walls or itself. The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or its own body. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible by eating as much food as you can.

## Features

- **Classic Snake Gameplay:** Control the snake using arrow keys.
- **Growing Snake:** The snake grows longer each time it eats food.
- **Game Over Condition:** The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the wall.

## Reference Video

I referred to a tutorial video by [CodeWithMosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y62MJny9LHg&t=329s) for understanding the basics of Java GUI programming and handling the snake's body and head. The video provided a foundation for setting up the game window and managing the snake's visual representation on the screen. However, all game logic, such as movement, collision detection, and score handling, was implemented independently.
